# Java File Encryptor üîê

A secure Java application for file encryption and decryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with 128-bit key encryption.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AES Encryption**: Military-grade encryption algorithm
- **Password-Based Key Derivation**: Uses PBKDF2 for secure key generation
- **File Handling**: Encrypts and decrypts any file type
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling and user feedback
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy use

## üöÄ How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of command line

### Compilation
```bash
javac FileEncryptor.java
```

### Encryption
```bash
java FileEncryptor
# Choose option 1 (Encrypt)
# Input file: sample.txt
# Output file: encrypted.enc
# Password: your-secure-password
```

### Decryption
```bash
java FileEncryptor
# Choose option 2 (Decrypt)
# Input file: encrypted.enc
# Output file: decrypted.txt
# Password: your-secure-password
```
